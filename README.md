# School_District_Analysis

# Overview of analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to replace inaccurate data from the ninth-grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School. We then repeated the district analysis completed from the module, breaking down district summary, school summary, the top and bottom performing schools based on overall passing rate. We also then looked at the average reading and math scores from each grade level from each school. Then looked at school spending per student, student size, and by school type and the scores received.

# Results
