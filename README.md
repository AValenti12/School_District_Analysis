# School_District_Analysis

# Overview of analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to replace inaccurate data from the ninth-grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School. We then repeated the district analysis completed from the module, breaking down district summary, school summary, the top and bottom performing schools based on overall passing rate. We also then looked at the average reading and math scores from each grade level from each school. Then looked at school spending per student, student size, and by school type and the scores received.

# Results

With removing the ninthgraders at Thomas High school, the change is not that drastic as the it is a large dataset and the number of ninth graders at that school did not significantly impact the overall data. There was a change in Thomas High School scores and overall passing percentage.
