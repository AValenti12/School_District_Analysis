# School_District_Analysis

# Overview of analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to replace inaccurate data from the ninth-grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School. We then repeated the district analysis completed from the module, breaking down district summary, school summary, the top and bottom performing schools based on overall passing rate. We also then looked at the average reading and math scores from each grade level from each school. Then looked at school spending per student, student size, and by school type and the scores received.

# Results

- With removing the ninthgraders at Thomas High school, the change is not that drastic, as the it is a large dataset and the number of ninth graders at that school did not significantly impact the district summary and school summary.
-Replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores effected Thomas High schools performance as it did lower the percentages but not extremely significantly. 
-There was not a significant change to the math and reading scores by grade.
-Schools spending was not affected by removing the ninth graders at Thomas High School.
-Scores by school size was not greatly affected.
-Scores by school type was not greatly affected.
